# Raw Audio End-to-End Deep Learning Architectures for Sound Event Detection
This is the accompanying Github repo for the thesis "Raw Audio End-to-End Deep Learning Architectures for Sound Event Detection" by Arvid Falch, UiO 2023. 

In this repo all the models trained for the thesis can be downloaded, as well as instructions for training and evaluating the models. 
Models and code coming before 1st of June 2023. 
## Models

## Training dataset
The training dataset can be downloaded from this Dropbox[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3jsvlptg971zjf1/AADiSkKnJweOYZyYBS_njgMRa?dl=0]. The dataset has been split into four training sets and four validation sets, which are used in the training loop to avoid filling up the GPU memory. The datasets are saved as .npz files. Keep them in the same folder as the Train.py file. 

Training dataset can also be downloaded and constructed from DESED link, follwo the instructions on that page.
